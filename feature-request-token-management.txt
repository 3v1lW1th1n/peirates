# Service Account pivoting

UI needs to say which token we're operating with and track all gathered tokens

0. Store path where we got token


1. When user switches token, ask them to give the token a name

2. Upon loading token from filesystem, store token's name -- we can get that with 

kubectl describe pod frontend-8d97dfbc5-bv5s8 | grep /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount | awk '{print $3}' 

3. Build a token array, so that every entered token can be placed in the array and we can let the user choose from tokens.
