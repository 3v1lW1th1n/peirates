Use Jay's GCP-based Kubernetes cluster by sshing into bustakube_mt@bustakubegcp, then running curl commands to find the kubelet token and key.

Start by using this to learn what GCP bucket the initial kube_env.yaml-type script is there:

 curl -s -H 'Metadata-Flavor: Google' 'http://metadata.google.internal/0.1/meta-data/attributes/startup-script'

 Go investigate that bucket named there.

Get a list of service account secrets from here:

Buckets/kubernetes-clusters-mt/multitenant.k8s.local/secrets

Try the one called admin!!!
